Installing
==========

The recommended way of installing the Dataplicity Python module and command line app is via pip (http://www.pip-installer.org).

To install Dataplicity, run the following from the command line::

    pip install dataplicity

You may need to prefix above command with `sudo` on some systems, e.g.::

    sudo pip install dataplicity

If you have previously installed Dataplicity, and want to get the latest, then you can run the following::

    sudo pip install dataplicity --upgrade

To confirm that Dataplicity was installed, and to check the current version, run the following::

    dataplicity --version
